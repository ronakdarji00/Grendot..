                        The consumption of energy has always been in exponential growth and also there is always an increasing demand in the requirement of energy in some way or the other. So, there is a need to search for energy availability from alternate sources of energy. The utilization of waste energy of foot power with human locomotion is relevant and important for highly populated countries like India where the railway station, temples, etc., are overcrowded all round the clock. When the flooring is engineered with piezoelectric technology, the electrical energy produced by the pressure is captured by floor sensors and converted to an electrical charge by piezo transducers, then stored and used as a power source. This paper deals with the generation of alternate sources of energy through piezoelectric materials. This research describes the use of piezoelectric materials to harvest energy from people walking vibration for generating and accumulating energy. This study also studies the perceptions and adaptability of piezoelectricity. The adaptability of piezoelectric technology in a real-time environment has been studied by comparing the overall cost of generating electricity with solar energy. This study also suggests a footstep of the piezoelectric energy harvesting model which is cost-effective and easy to implement.

                        In India energy constitutes 52% of the commercial and industrial respondents. With the yearly rise in the demand for electricity throughout the country it is high time that we think about generating cleaner sources of electricity. For this already the Indian power sector has taken various initiatives to promote renewable sources of power like solar, wind, hydro, etc. through policies and schemes that overall benefit the entire stakeholders. But still, there need many more ways through which electricity can be generated.

                        For an alternate method to generate electricity, there are a number of methods by which electricity can be produced,                        out of such methods footstep energy generation can be an effective method to generate electricity.

                        Considering the daily emerging demand for power and the global climatic changes there is a heavy requirement of                         cleaner sources of power before it is too late. Also, India has set targets of achieving 175 GW of power by 2022                        only through renewable forms of energy. Keeping in mind the above ambitious targets that countries are putting forth                    regarding the cleaner sources of fuel, there is an urgent requirement of alternate sources of power that not only                       satisfies the requirement but also meets the financial, adoption, and implementation into the real-time scenarios as                    well. Below, the shares of energy generation in India

                                our idea is to generate power by simply walking or generating enery by foot steps on the tiles
                                The genius of the Pizeo-Tiles is its
                                simplicity. It consists of three
                                components. An electro-magnetic
                                generator, a singular composite tile,
                                and people. The tiles create a unique

                    <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
                    <p>TThe weight from each step across Pavegen tiles creates a
                        small vertical movement of 5mm-10mm compressing an
                        electromagnetic generator and creating a rotary motion to
                        produce 2-4 joules of off-grid, clean energy.
                        We use this energy to power sustainability tools like LED
                        lighting, living wall irrigation, and smart street furniture
                        alongside capturing rich data insights for brands to
                        connect with stakeholders.</p>
